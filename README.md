# OOP-SVG-logo-maker

## Project Description

The task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG fileLinks to an external site.. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## Problem

USER STORY

AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered



## Solution
Once the code is entered into the correct files, I ran 'node index.js' into the terminal and given a prompt to enter values. Once the values were entered then an SVG file was rendered into 'logo.svg'.

Note: I forgot to mention tests in my walkthrough video so please see below for a screenshot of the tests being run.
